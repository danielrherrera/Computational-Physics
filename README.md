Assaignment 8
The purpose of this assaignment was to create a self defined energy function calculating an arrays different energy values with a corresponding speed of light value. 
The second portion of the assaignment is to create an array of 20 continuous values and manipulating them into different function values. Once manipulated, we then graph them all amongst the same graph and see the differences amongst them.
